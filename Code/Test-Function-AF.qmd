Set things up
```{r}
rm(list = ls())
library(tidyverse)
library(here)
```

Here is where I am going to test different functions that will help me to figure out how to make the final function

I will use some more simplistic functions and stuff to test these

First try:

```{r}
combined_csv <- function(path = "."){
  # create a list of all the csv files in the given directory
  # use list.files() and make it recursive to go through sub-directories
  csv_list <- list.files(path = path, recursive = TRUE, pattern = "//.csv$", full.names = TRUE)
  
  # read in each csv in the list
  df_list <- lapply(csvs, read.csv)
  
  # combine all the data frames in the list
  # this only works if all the columns are the same
  combined_df <- do.call(rbind, df_list)
  
  return(combined_df)
}
```
